### Create online apps using Typst

`typ-pad` provides a Typst template to provide an easy way to write one-file, one-page web apps. Use Typst to generate the page content, including input elements. Then use JavaScript and Typst (optionally) to calculate and display results. The standalone file can be used by itself, either through a webserver or even just opening the HTML file in a browser.

By default, `typ-pad` apps use [mdpad](https://mdpad.netlify.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/tshort/mdpad-js)). `mdpad` provides user-interface code to make it easier to write apps. Originally, this was used with Markdown, but it also works well with pages generated by Typst. It works well with traditional static-site generators like Jekyll or Hugo. I've used `mdpad` professionally for several engineering apps ([example](https://distributionhandbook.com/calculators/fault-simulator/)). `mdpad` is easy, because the user input is very basic. By default, results are updated any time users change inputs. For more sophisticated interactivity and state management, one an use more sophisticated JavaScript packages. 

For generating HTML with Typst, the [hyperscript](https://github.com/tshort/hyperscript) package helps.

## Examples

* [Example 2](https://tshort.github.io/typ-pad/examples/2/)--Typst is used to generate content on the fly.

## Template

This package provides the `typ-pad` function to use as a template. Use it with `#show`. Here is an example from one of the examples:

```typ
#show: typ-pad.with(
  title: "Typ-pad: summing sinusoids",
  links: (
    (rel: "stylesheet", href: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css"),
    (rel: "icon", type: "svg/xml", href: "data:image/svg+xml,<svg viewBox='0 0 256 256' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><rect fill='none' height='256' width='256'/><path d='M24,128c104-224,104,224,208,0' fill='none' stroke='%23000' stroke-linecap='round' stroke-linejoin='round' stroke-width='19'/></svg>"),
  ),
  typst-online: typs, 
  js: js)
```

The `typ-pad` function has several named arguments that affect HTML generation. 
- `title` (default: `""`): Title of the HTML document.
- `heads` (default: `()`): Array of content to be included in `<head>`.
- `heads-default` (default: `true`): Whether to include the following defaults in `<head>`.
```html
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
- `links` (default: `()`): Array of dictionaries where each includes parameters of a `<link>` to include in `<head>`.
- `js` (default: `""`): Code to include at the end of the body. Can be a string or raw.
- `js-includes` (default: `()`): An array of JavaScript links to include.
- `mdpad` (default: `true`): Include JavaScript `mdpad` files.
- `typst-online` (default: `(:)`): Include JavaScript and WebAssembly code to enable Typst to be used to generate content online.
- `full-html` (default: `true`): Include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

## Comparisons

Advantages of using Typst to generate online apps include:
- Only a single input file is required, and Typst generates a single output file. It should fit in well with static-site generators.
- Pages work even without a webserver.
- Typst is more powerful than Markdown. Functions to generate content are natural.
- Typst or JavaScript code is easy to include via triple backticks, and these are syntax highlighted in VS Code.
- Typst can optionally be used online to generate content dynamically.

Some disadvantages include:
- On cannot currently assign id's to components of an SVG file that Typst generates. That makes it difficult to provide interaction from the outside.

The online Typst capability is restrictive:
- Currently, only SVG's can be inserted by the online Typst capability. In the future, [typst-ts](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/typst.ts/) might be expanded to use the HTML exporter to allow a larger variety of content generation.
- Online Typst usage requires downloading a 20-MB wasm file.
- Unlike JavaScript, online Typst code can't interact with page content.
